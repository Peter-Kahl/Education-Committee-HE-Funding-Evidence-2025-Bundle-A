Today, I have submitted my first instalment of evidence to the House of Commons Education Select Committee’s inquiry into Higher Education and Funding: Threat of Insolvency and International Students.

The memorandum—_Governance Opacity and the Financial Sustainability Crisis in English Higher Education: Fiduciary Conflicts, Insolvency Risk, and the Limits of Parliamentary Privilege_—sets out a stark picture: governance opacity and unmanaged fiduciary conflicts are not minor procedural oversights. They are a primary cause of the mounting insolvency risk across English higher-education institutions.

Using Office for Students data from 2020–2024, I identify ten universities whose financial sustainability scores have declined by 20% or more, several now sitting in the highest-risk E category. In each case, the deterioration coincides with material governance conflicts—cross-appointments to lobbying bodies such as HEPI or Advance HE, or related-party commercial interests.

The paper does three things:

1. Documents the correlation between governance opacity and financial decline.

2. Analyses the statutory duties under the Charities Act 2011 and Companies Act 2006, alongside the limits of parliamentary privilege under the Bill of Rights 1689.

3. Proposes three targeted, cost-effective reforms:
    - A statutory, real-time conflicts-of-interest register.
    - A new OfS licence condition mandating fiduciary openness.
    - A “failure-to-prevent-dishonesty” offence for trustees and governors.

This is Bundle A—the first wave. In my correspondence with Dr Edward Hicks (Second Clerk to the Committee), I have indicated that Bundle B—a 50-page supplementary dossier—will follow in the coming days. I also stand ready to provide oral evidence or any further documentation the Committee requires.

Transparency matters. The full PDF of my submission is available [here (PDF)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peter-Kahl/Education-Committee-HE-Funding-Evidence-2025-Bundle-A/master/Governance_Opacity_and_the_Financial_Sustainability_Crisis_2025-08-08.pdf).

From the front line of the UK Higher Education crisis, this is a fight for accountability, solvency, and the public interest.
